## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v14 or later)
-   npm
-   MongoDB (local instance or a MongoDB Atlas account)

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sachin27182003/URL-Shortner-tool.git
    cd URL_Shortner-tool
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following variables:

    ```
    MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
    BASE_URL = <your_backend_url>
    ```

    Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The backend will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

3.  **Frontend Setup:**

    Open a new terminal window.

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

    Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add a variable:

    ```

    VITE_API_URL = <'your_backend_url'>
    ```

    Start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:5173`.


## Deployment

This URL Shortener Tool project is fully deployed and accessible online, making it easy for anyone to shorten and share URLs without running the application locally.

-   **Frontend (Vercel) :** https://url-shortner-tool-kappa.vercel.app/
The user-facing interface where you can enter a long URL, generate a shortened link, and manage your URLs.

-   **Backend End Point (Render) :** https://url-shortner-tool.onrender.com/
The server-side application that handles URL shortening, redirection, and visit tracking.


-   **Database :** MongoDB Atlas â€” Stores all original URLs, their shortened codes, and visit counts.

## How It Works in Production
- You visit the Frontend Live Demo and paste a long URL into the form.

- The frontend sends a request to the Backend API.

- The backend generates a short code, saves it in MongoDB Atlas, and returns the shortened link.

- Clicking the shortened link redirects you to the original URL and increments the visit count.

- The deployed version mirrors local development but is optimized for real-world usage, with cross-origin access enabled between the hosted frontend and backend.

## ðŸŒŸ Thank You for Checking Out This Project
Thank you for taking the time to explore the URL Shortener Tool! This project has been a great journey in applying my skills in full-stack web development, from designing the user interface to building the backend API and deploying a fully functional web application connected to a live database.

I genuinely appreciate your interest in this project. Whether you are a recruiter, fellow developer, or curious visitor, your time here means a lot to me. I believe in building tools that are simple, efficient, and enjoyable to use, and I hope this application reflects that philosophy.

If you have ideas for improvements, spot any issues, or simply want to collaborate, Iâ€™m always open to feedback and contributions. Letâ€™s connect and make better tools together! ðŸš€
